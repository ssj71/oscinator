This is a simple OSC client (generator) for desktop using PyQT5.

It has 4 buttons and 4 sliders.
Configure a url and port and it will automatically connect.
Editing the textboxes below the widgets adjusts the values sent on press/release/slider change etc.
The defaults are made to work with the generic.omm mapping with my OSC2MIDI application.

It depends on PyQt5 and python-osc which on ubuntu (20.04) can be installed with
'''
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
pip3 install python-osc
'''


Using liblo tools you can test with 
'oscdump 9000'
to see the messages the OSCniator sends.

Enjoy.
